<h2> When is tutoring useful? </h2>
	<p> Tutoring can greatly help some student achieve their goals and potential, but it isn't for everyone. We find students benefit the most from tutoring when there is a clear goal in mind from the start. For example the goal might be to: achieve a certain grade in an exam, pass an entrance test, cover a certain topic in detail, learn a particular skill, catch up on missed schooling, or provide challenging extension work beyond the normal curriculum. So if you are interested in tutoring it is worth first asking yourself what would you want tutoring to achieve.</p>
	<p>If there isn't a clear goal then tutoring might not be very helpful. But no need to worry there are plenty of other ways to improve in a particular subject. Alternative ways of supporting a student include: online resources, in school support, revision classes, study groups, popular science books, and public lectures. For some of our favourite free online resources see our <a href='resources.html'>resources</a> page. </p>
<h2> What can tutoring achieve? </h2>
	<p>Sadly tutors are not miracle workers so it's important to be realistic about what tutoring can achieve and over what timescale. To help correct misconceptions in one topic may take a single tutoring session but to raise a couple of grades at A-Level would likely take many months. So make sure you leave enougth time before any exams/tests for the tutoring to have an effect. Some examples of goals we have worked towards with previous students are: passing grammar school 11+ entrance exams (this can take a long time to prepare for- we would advise speaking to a tutor 12-6 months before the exam), revising GCSE content and preparing for the transition to A-level (about 9 hour long sessions), and helping to challenge students who are bored with their schoolwork.  However it is important to remember tutoring will not achieve much if the student is not willing to engange and learn the subject.
	</p><p>Tutors CANNOT give a student answers to any tests or sit an exam for the student. This would both be illegal and immoral. In addition we have decided we WILL NOT accept money to prepare students for university interviews due to it being both dubious morally, on grounds of equal access to higher education, and generally ineffective and so a waste of the tutees time and money. We will, however, offer free advice and help for students whose school are not able to offer them help in preparing for university interviews or whose families are not able or willing to help them practise. Please <a href='contactus.html'>contact us</a> to ask about this. </p>

<h2>How much do you charge (and why)? </h2>
	<p> We charge different amounts for different subjects at different levels due to the varying amounts of time it takes to prepare each tutoring session. An hour tutoring session will often take another hour and a half to three hours to prepare and mark any homework as a specialised lesson plan needs to be created and in some cases resources made for the student. In cases where money is a barrier to students accessing tutoring we are happy to consider reduced fees but this would be considered on a case by case basis. </p>
